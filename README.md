Update all global modules.

Installation: `npm i -g update-everything`

Usage: `update-everything`

This will update ALL your globally installed modules.
This may take quite a while. And some stuff might break.
This will prompt you to be sure you want to do this.

Depends heavily on [global-packages](https://github.com/zeit/global-packages)
and, of course, [npm](https://npmjs.com).

Also check out [global-packages-cli](https://npmjs.com/package/global-packages-cli),
to list your globally-installed packages in text or JSON.
